					<span class="title">WHY THIS CONFERENCE?<br></span> <br>


					<b style="font-size: 1.2em;">Sub Theme 1: Skilled Millenials: Pillars of startup ecosystem & creators of Millenial India<br>
					</b>
					<i>Current scenario</i><br>

					<p>India currently holds the distinction for being one of the youngest nations in the world, i.e. largest youth demography. According to a report by The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, over 54% of India’s total population is below 25 years of age, and over 62% of the population comes under the working age group (15-59 years). It also predicts that our country’s working age population will be far in excess of those dependent on them, this will continue for at least three decades and is expected to swell across the stated working age over the year 2040. This has increasingly been recognized as a potential source of significant strength for the national economy, provided we are able to equip and continuously upgrade the skills of the population in the working age group.</p>

					<p>Statistics point out that India’s workforce is set to increase by 32% in the next 20 years, according to the Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs. A skill gap analysis conducted by the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) in 2014 reports an incremental requirement of 109.73 million skilled manpower by 2022 across 24 key sectors. It is estimated that a mere 4.69% of the total workforce in India has undergone formal skill training of any sort compared to 68% in the UK, 75% in Germany, 52% in the US, 80% in Japan and 96% in South Korea. </p>

					<p>Thus, it has now become a matter of extreme importance for India to utilize its demographic dividend and overcome the Skills gap within a limited timeline.
					</p>
					<p>To handle this skill gap that’s hovering over the economic development of the country, PM Narendra Modi had launched Skill India Initiative in 2015 to train about 400 million people by 2022. The project seems ambitious but the recent approval of Rs 17273 crores by the Cabinet shows that the Government is taking serious steps to bridge the gap of supply and demand of talent. The technological evolution that is sweeping the entire corporate sector introduces new skills every day, and to keep up with the newer skill sets it has become essential for the Government and the industry to come together to find the perfect solution. Also Skill development is critical for achieving faster, sustainable and inclusive growth on the one hand and for providing decent employment opportunities to the growing young population on the other. Countries with higher and better levels of skills adjust more effectively to the challenges and opportunities of world of work.</p>
					<p>Since its launch last July, this mission has garnered lots of support from various industries and initiators – Government or otherwise, who have come forward to address the issue of Skills gap in the country, and are doing their bit to fill that void with a trained and certified labour force. However, there are various aspects to this mission that need proper consideration in order to maintain its successful implementation. In recognition of these needs, the Government of India has adopted skill development as a national priority over the next 10 years. The Eleventh Five Year Plan detailed a road-map for skill development in India, and favoured the formation of Skill Development Missions, both at the State and National levels. As a result National Skill Development Coordination Board (NSDCB) and the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) was created in early 2008.
					</p>
					<p>Moreover Upskilling more than 40 crore individuals in multifarious fields by the year 2022 can seem like an achievable task on paper, but it is actually far from it. Undertakings of such magnitude need constant deliberation and have to be improvised at each step to counter every challenge on its path to success. Furthermore, it is predicted that the government may have to devote more than INR 8 Lakh Crore to this mission gradually over the next 8 years in order to accomplish this task.</p>

					<p>However, things have begun to look promising on this front ever since the Budget for 2017 was announced, with the Ministry of Finance allocating over 17273 Crores for this mission. Additionally, the ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship has also announced some provisions for initiatives under this scheme – INR 3016 Crores have been set aside for skilling institutions under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY scheme). The main objective of this funding is to support development of infrastructure in this field which can help skill more than 1 Crore youth within the next 3 years. </p>

					<p>Leading corporations have also taken an active role in working with ITIs to strengthen them and improve the quality of learning outcomes from the institutions. An thus fulfilling mission’s objective of enabling ITIs (Industrial Training Institutes) to make a name for themselves globally in this century, as did by IITs in last century.
					</p>

					<span class="subtitle"><b>Purpose:</b></span>

					<p>Over the past couple of months, we have witnessed that ‘Skill India’, in general, has been talked about on numerous occasions, specifically on how this mission can achieve its target. Most people now have a general idea on the extent of this initiative and how it has helped thousands of individuals to become job-ready professionals with proper training. Now, we are going to explore how this comprehensive pan India movement can play an integral part in reforming the future of our country through <strong>STRATAGEM 1.0 </strong></p>

					<p><i style="font-size: 1.3em;">The aim of this conference is to provide a platform to Industry professionals, startpreneurs, policymakers, Training Institutes, skill councils, NGOs, Govt bodies etc to highlight how Skill development is critical for achieving faster, sustainable and inclusive growth on one hand and providing employment opportunities to the growing young population on the other. Also how our next generation entrepreneurs can contribute into this mission and help our citizen to attain higher and better levels of skills to adjust more effectively to the challenges and opportunities of world of work through these initiatives.

				<b style="font-size: 1.2em;">Sub Theme 2: Role of ICT in building user centric services and citizen driven innovations
				</b><br>
				<i>Current Scenario
				</i><br>
				<p>Even though India is known as a powerhouse of software, the availability of electronic government services to citizens is still comparatively low. The Digital India programme has been launched with an aim of transforming the country into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy. The Digital India would ensure that Government services are available to citizens electronically. It would also bring in public accountability through mandated delivery of government’s services electronically; a Unique ID and e-Pramaan based on authentic and standard based interoperable and integrated government applications and data basis. The Digital India vision provides the intensified impetus for further momentum and progress for this initiative and this would promote inclusive growth that covers electronic services, products, devices, manufacturing and job opportunities. India in the 21st Century must strive to meet the aspirations of its citizens where government and its services reach the doorsteps of citizens and contribute towards a long-lasting positive impact.  The Digital India Programme aims to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy by leveraging IT as a growth engine of new India. The project focuses on being transformative that helps realize the popular equation i.e. IT+IT= IT, which means Indian Talent + Information Technology = India Tomorrow.

				<p>Digital India’ is a vision, which is based on three key areas. The first is Digital Infrastructure as a core utility to every citizen. The objective is to make various utilities available to the citizens through cutting-edge digital infrastructure. It will enable delivery of services like banking and access to service centres at the doorstep of citizens with the assistance of high speed internet. The second area of vision is Governance and services on demand. It will be through focus on governance and services. This digital movement will bring everything in the palms of people across departments and places. It will enable providing services to people in real time, cutting across every hindrance. It will also enhance the usage of cloud services and enable citizens to receive their due just from these services. Furthering the benefits, it will ease the procedures for starting businesses in India and even the financial transactions will become effortless as people wouldn’t have to set foot outside their houses. The third and the foremost vision is Digital empowerment of citizens. The digital resources, like documents etc. will be easily available on the cloud, making access to information easier and faster. This will consequently lead to a digital revolution in the country. Further, the services would be friendlier as they would be available in native languages, making their penetration comprehensible and vast.</p>

				<p>With e-Governance coming into power, the private sector sees a lot of opportunity in this space. This will magnify the efficiency of the Government and induce more transparency into the system. Digital payment companies stand to benefit with this move as it will increase the number of people accessing Internet in India. The future of a country is generally determined by the growth of its economy and the Digital India campaign is one such way that will not only strengthen the economy of India, but will also play a major role in putting India in the league of developed nations. The transformation of the country into a knowledge economy will ensure the industry gets rock solid support and a fertile ground to flourish in the time to come. Additionally, the huge investment of Rs.1.13 lakh-crore and 18 lakh direct or indirect jobs in the country will generate trust among major investors across the globe making it the new mecca for emerging technologies. Consequently, the next Apple or Facebook might just come from India!</p>

				<p>Furthering the benefits of Digital India, the roadmap ahead looks promising. By the year 2019, 2.5 lakh villages will have broadband connection along with the added feature of phone connectivity. The imports of the country will turn zero as India will have a staggering 400, 000 Public Internet Access Points. Not only that, over 2.5 lakh educational institutions including schools and universities will have Wi-Fi facility. The program aims to impact the employment scenario immensely by increasing skills and job prospects. It is estimated that by 2019, about 1.7 crore young Indians will have proper training in IT, Telecom and electronics. This directly leads to 1.7 crore jobs for Indian Youth in about four years from now.</p>
